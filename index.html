        <h1>Khalil Anderson</h1>
        <p></p>Hi I'm Khalil. I was born in the Bronx, New York and I lived in New York until I was 7. I then moved to Woodstock, Maryland Which is in Howard County. A county that is very well known for its good school. Also, Ellicott City is one of the best place to go for a public school education which was my neighboring city. 
        <p>I played soccer for 14 years. I've travel from Buffalo, NY to Orlando, FL to London, England. This much experience in soccer has forced to develop teamworking skills along with leadership skills to help my team succeed while taking in considerations of other players along with accomadating to challenge such as being injured for 9 months with Hamstring tear.</p>
        <p>I begun program when I was in 9th grade and have flourished ever since. I loved it from the beginning. Every program I make feels like my own baby. I love making new things and making things better by using my knowledge and fighting against challenges.</p>
